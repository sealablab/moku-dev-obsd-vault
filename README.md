# Moku VHDL Development Knowledge Base

## Purpose
This repository serves as the **top-level entry point** for the Obsidian notes vault within the [moku-vhdl-dev-workspace](https://github.com/sealablab/moku-vhdl-dev-workspace) project.

## Important Note
**Despite the current directory structure, this README represents the ACTUAL top of your Obsidian notes vault.**

When you open this workspace in Obsidian, this knowledge base becomes your central hub for all notes, documentation, and knowledge management.

## What This Means
- **Obsidian Vault Root**: This is where your Obsidian notes start
- **Knowledge Hub**: All your VHDL development knowledge flows through here
- **Central Reference**: The main entry point for your development documentation

## Current Status
The directory structure is still being organized. In Obsidian, this will become your clean, organized knowledge vault.

---

*This is the knowledge management foundation for your VHDL development work.*
