# Moku VHDL Development Knowledge Base

## Purpose
This repository serves as the centralized knowledge management system for the [moku-vhdl-dev-workspace](https://github.com/sealablab/moku-vhdl-dev-workspace) project. It contains structured documentation, design decisions, component analysis, and technical research that complements the VHDL source code and implementation.

## Relationship to Main Workspace

### How It Works
1. **Main Workspace**: Contains all VHDL source code, examples, and project files
2. **Knowledge Base**: This repository contains the intellectual framework and documentation
3. **Obsidian Integration**: The main workspace serves as an Obsidian vault, with this knowledge base as a tracked submodule
4. **Cross-References**: Notes in this repository can link directly to files in the main workspace

## Git Workflow

### This Repository
- **Independent Version Control**: Notes are version controlled separately from code
- **Focused Commits**: Changes to knowledge base are isolated from code changes
- **Easy Sharing**: Knowledge can be shared independently of implementation

### Main Workspace
- **Submodule Integration**: This repository is included as a git submodule
- **Obsidian Vault**: The entire workspace serves as an Obsidian vault
- **Direct Linking**: Notes can link directly to source files and documentation

## Contributing

### Adding New Knowledge
1. **Create Notes**: Use the established directory structure
2. **Link Appropriately**: Connect to relevant components and concepts
3. **Follow Templates**: Use provided templates for consistency
4. **Commit Changes**: Version control your knowledge contributions

### Maintaining Quality
- **Regular Updates**: Keep knowledge current with implementation changes
- **Cross-References**: Maintain links between related concepts
- **Review Process**: Ensure accuracy and completeness

## Technical Notes

### Obsidian Integration
- **Vault Root**: The main workspace serves as the Obsidian vault root
- **File Access**: Full access to all files in the workspace
- **Linking**: Direct links to VHDL files, documentation, and examples
- **Search**: Obsidian can search through all linked content

### Git Submodule Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Knowledge vs. implementation
- **Independent Evolution**: Knowledge can evolve separately from code
- **Easy Updates**: Simple git submodule update commands
- **Clean History**: Knowledge changes don't clutter code history
