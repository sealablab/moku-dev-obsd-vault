# ProbeDriver6-prompt
Dex, the time has come to finally describe in  detail the first real-world VHDL module I would to to generate. I call it `ProbeDriver-NG`, and I am using it as a 'benchmark' of sorts for the overall cursor VHDL workspace. 


Honestly, I know __exactly__ what I want this to do (largely because I have built it so many times). What I really want to do is focus on generating a requirements document that efficiently captures and describes the functionality.


## ProbeDriver6 - Backround
The goal of the ProbeDriver6 (PB6 for short) is to develop a reusable VHDL state-machine / module that is capabale of driving multiple fault-injection / side-channel analysis probes and synthesizable with LiquidInstruments moku cloud compiler. 

The following documents describe the probe(s) in question we intend to add initial support for. 

#JCRET2HERE: I guess it is time to 'sync/merge/<whatever> we can in terms of Riscure and LiquidInstrument datasheets.'
