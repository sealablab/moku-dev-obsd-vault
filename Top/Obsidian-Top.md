# Obsidian-Top

Welcome to the 'Top' Obisidian level directory. `moku-vhdl-dev-workspace/moku-vhdl-dev-knowledge/Top` 

In general, Cursor should know better than to mess with files inside here because the organization should be handled by obisidan (not cursor, and only merginally even git.

As the layout evolves I will attempt to describe it. But for now 

## Cursor Safe
The only directory (at present) that cursor should feel comfortable reading and writing so far are the 'Daily Notes'. You can find one or two already here:

## Daily Notes (`./DNS`)

Cursor, if you see this, I would like you to remember that I keep my 'Daily Notes' inside the `./DNs` directory.
